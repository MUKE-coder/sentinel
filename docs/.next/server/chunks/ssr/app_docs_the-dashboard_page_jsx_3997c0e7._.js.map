The dashboard is built\n        with React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS 4, Recharts, and React Router, and is served directly\n        from your Go binary at <code>/sentinel/ui</code> — no separate frontend deployment required.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The entire UI uses a dark theme optimized for security operations. All assets are compiled\n        into your Go binary via <code>go:embed</code>, so the dashboard works out of the box with\n        zero external dependencies at runtime.\n      </p>\n\n      <Callout type=\"info\" title=\"Enabled by Default\">\n        The dashboard is enabled by default when you call <code>sentinel.Mount()</code>. Navigate\n        to <code>http://localhost:8080/sentinel/ui</code> to access it. You can disable it by\n        setting <code>DashboardConfig.Enabled</code> to <code>false</code>.\n      </Callout>\n\n      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}\n      {/*  AUTHENTICATION                                                     */}\n      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}\n\n      <h2 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h2>\n      <p>\n        The dashboard is protected by JWT-based authentication. When you access the UI, you are\n        presented with a login screen that accepts a username and password. These credentials are\n        configured in the <code>DashboardConfig</code> struct.\n      </p>\n\n      <CodeBlock\n        language=\"go\"\n        filename=\"main.go\"\n        code={`sentinel.Mount(r, nil, sentinel.Config{\n    Dashboard: sentinel.DashboardConfig{\n        Username:  \"admin\",\n        Password:  \"s3cur3-p4ss!\",\n        SecretKey: \"my-jwt-secret-change-in-production\",\n    },\n})`}\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        On successful login, the server returns a JWT token. The React app stores this token\n        exclusively in React state (via <code>useState</code> inside an <code>AuthContext</code>\n        provider) — it is never written to <code>localStorage</code>, <code>sessionStorage</code>,\n        or cookies. This means the token is automatically cleared when the browser tab is closed or\n        the page is refreshed, providing a secure session model that is immune to XSS-based token\n        theft from persistent storage.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Every subsequent API call includes the token in the <code>Authorization: Bearer</code>{' '}\n        header. If the token expires or becomes invalid, the API responds with HTTP 401 and the\n        dashboard automatically redirects to the login page.\n      </p>\n\n      <Callout type=\"warning\" title=\"Change Default Credentials\">\n        The default username is <code>admin</code> and the default password is{' '}\n        <code>sentinel</code>. Always change these in production. The <code>SecretKey</code> is used\n        to sign JWT tokens — if compromised, an attacker can forge dashboard sessions.\n      </Callout>\n\n      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}\n      {/*  PAGES OVERVIEW                                                     */}\n      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}\n\n      <h2 id=\"pages\">Pages Overview</h2>\n      <p>\n        The dashboard contains 13 pages, each focused on a specific aspect of your security\n        operations.
